### Potential Negative Societal Impacts

Autonomous drone systems have potential to help solidify unjust power systems by contributing to a technological imbalance between the government and the people underneath. Drones with mapping and navigation capabilities can contribute to surveillance and tracking, collecting personal information on a large population without their consent. Furthermore, drone localization can be used to conduct autonomous and surgical attacks, contributing to casualties of those who do not have the ability to defend themselves, while posing minimal risk to those with this technology.

### General Ethical Conduct

This technology should not be used to generate maps of private property without the explicit permission of the property owners. Our technology uses a drone camera to create and save a map of its environment; the video feed, which could capture people, vehicles, or any other personally identifying information should not be saved.

### Responsible Use

We want the system to be used only in cases where all people affected by the system output (i.e. for first responder teams, the teams driving the drone as well as the persons being searched for) are affected positively. I.e., search and rescue is OK, but searching for a criminal in a manhunt is not. Even though the person has “done wrong”, they are still a negatively affected person in the system. In addition, the drone should only be used in cases where human work is impractical or dangerous. These two requirements would look like: using drones to map the inside of abandoned buildings to identify hazards before demolition. This would allow for human teams to work more efficiently with knowledge of where and what they are looking at.

The play “Rossum’s Universal Robots” was the introduction of the term “robot”. Their ‘robots’ were biological humanoids more strong and ‘efficient’ without freewill sold to governments with the promise of not being used for war. Obviously, the government used the robots to suit their own ends. They were used in war. Corporations used them to replace every human labor, and humanity forgot how to do all of the things that were considered “work”; poverty and exclusion ran rampant. Once these now warlike robots gained sentience, they quickly disposed of all humans.

This framing puts the onus on us to vett the groups that we sell to, as well as thinking about the systematic effects that our production will have on society as a whole. It is not enough to ask that our customers avoid actions, but up to us to ensure that we are not selling to any actors involved in those negative actions. There is frequently the justification of ‘if I won’t sell it, someone else will!’. The spreading of a mindset of progress involves the sacrifice of individual gain for a greater good. Even though the companies which follow these guidelines will be less profitable inherently, at least we won’t spell the end of times as we know it.
